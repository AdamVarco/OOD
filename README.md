# OOD
Object Oriented Design
A simple Object Oriented Java project.
Class Car extends Car_H - an Abstract class which has one abstract method called PrintCar.
This method is overrided in the Car to implement the method.
Two interfaces, one called Car_I with the method go in it, and the other Car_S with the method Stop in it.
You can see that both of these interaces are implemented in the Car class, thus kind of using multiple inheritance, even though there is no such thing in Java.
You can see an overloaded constructor in the Car class, one constructor has no arguments, the other does.
You can even see an Enum used in this project, which makes things easier when using predefined terms.
If you would like to know more about Enums, please read up on them in C/C++.
